## 2. Research Background and Related Work

This section outlines the existing research and provides context for the proposed methodology.

**2.1. Related Work**

This section reviews existing approaches to ransomware detection, focusing on feature encoding and the use of large language models (LLMs).

*   **Traditional Feature Encoding:** Previous methods primarily focused on encoding ransomware features using techniques like TextCNN, Bi-LSTM, and other basic encoders. However, these methods only served as feature encoders and lacked a deep understanding of the behavioral intentions and potential security risks associated with the software.
*   **LLMs in Cybersecurity:** The advent of pre-trained LLMs has significantly impacted NLP, demonstrating strong performance in various tasks. Some researchers have utilized LLMs like BERT to analyze raw feature semantics. However, the proposed research distinguishes itself by incorporating both internal semantic information from ransomware features and external semantics (expert knowledge) and by focusing on zero-day ransomware detection.

## 3. Methodology

This section details the proposed methodology, including LLM-assisted task-adaptive pre-training (LATAP) and task-specific fine-tuning.

### 3.1 LLM-assisted Task-adaptive Pre-training (LATAP)

This subsection describes the process of generating training data and pre-training the model.

*   **Training Data Generation:** The importance of task-adaptive pre-training (TAP) with small corpora is highlighted, leading to the design of LATAP. The process involves analyzing ransomware features and collecting official API descriptions and information on the Windows system registry. To enhance the corpus's quality, an advanced model (Ouyang et al., 2022) was used to generate additional data.  Manual review by cybersecurity experts (1.8% of data corrected) ensured data quality. The final corpus consists of 12% manually collected data and 88% data generated by advanced models.  Crucially, ransomware attack samples were excluded from the pre-training data to avoid unfair testing.
*   **Pre-training:** GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) was chosen as the base model (Embedding Size = 768, Decoder layer = 12, Parameter number = 124M). The rationale for selecting a smaller model includes its effectiveness for specific tasks, cost-effectiveness, ease of deployment, and mitigation of hardware supply chain challenges.

### 3.2 Task-specific Fine-tuning System

This subsection describes the overall system architecture for fine-tuning the model.  (Figure 2(b) is referenced). The system includes a Feature Semantic Processing module for internal semantic processing of dynamic features.

## Summary of Ransomware Detection and Classification Research

This research focuses on improving the detection and classification of ransomware, particularly addressing the challenge of zero-day attacks (new, previously unseen ransomware). The approach combines dynamic feature analysis with large language models (LLMs) and external semantic knowledge.

**1. Ransomware Classification (Identifying the Type of Ransomware)**

*   **Method:** The "SRDC" method is proposed, which leverages dynamic features and is enhanced by "LATAP" pre-training (incorporating external semantic knowledge).  It's compared to existing methods like VarLenPSO, KNN, LSTM, and BERT.
*   **Key Findings:**
    *   SRDC achieves the best performance in ransomware family classification, outperforming existing methods.
    *   SRDC demonstrates superior ability to recognize key features, even with sparse data (e.g., correctly classifying PGPCODER samples where VarLenPSO fails).
    *   LATAP pre-training significantly improves the ability to distinguish ransomware families, particularly those with limited data.
*   **Limitations (Based on Text):**
    *   Misclassifications often occur due to insufficient features in the samples.
    *   Rare ransomware families (e.g., PGPCODER, TeslaCrypt) pose a challenge due to limited data.

**2. Zero-Day Ransomware Detection (Identifying New, Unseen Ransomware)**

*   **Method:**  A zero-day detection task is set up by splitting ransomware families into "seen" (training) and "unseen" (testing) categories.  The SRDC-GPT model is fine-tuned.
*   **Key Findings:**
    *   SRDC achieves high accuracy, recall, and F1-score in zero-day ransomware detection, outperforming methods like SVM, GoogleNet, LSTM, Inception V3, ResNet50, and BERT.
    *   The DCAE-ZSLHVE method is also compared, and SRDC performs better.
*   **Experimental Setup:**
    *   Seen Classes: 7 ransomware families
    *   Unseen Classes: 4 ransomware families
    *   Test Set: 134 unseen ransomware samples + equal number of good software samples
    *   Training Set: 448 seen ransomware samples + 808 good software samples

**3. Key Techniques & Components**

*   **Dynamic Features:**  The research emphasizes the importance of dynamic features in ransomware analysis.
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** SRDC utilizes a GPT model, suggesting the use of LLMs for understanding and classifying ransomware behavior.
*   **LATAP Pre-training:**  This technique incorporates external semantic knowledge to enhance the model's understanding of ransomware characteristics.
*   **Balanced Accuracy:** Used to evaluate classification performance, especially important when dealing with imbalanced datasets (different numbers of samples per ransomware family).

**Table Summaries (from the text)**

*   **Table 3 (Classification Performance Comparison):** Shows SRDC's superior performance in classifying ransomware families compared to VarLenPSO.
*   **Table 6 (Overall Classification Accuracy):**  Compares SRDC with other methods (VarLenPSO, KNN, LSTM, BERT) in ransomware family classification.
*   **Table 7 (Train/Test Split for Zero-Day Detection):** Defines the seen and unseen ransomware families used for the zero-day detection task.
*   **Table 8 (Zero-Day Detection Performance):**  Compares SRDC with other methods (SVM, GoogleNet, LSTM, Inception V3, ResNet50, BERT, DCAE-ZSLHVE) in zero-day ransomware detection.



**Overall Conclusion:**

The research demonstrates the effectiveness of combining dynamic feature analysis with LLMs and external semantic knowledge for improved ransomware detection and classification, particularly in addressing the challenge of zero-day attacks.  However, limitations remain regarding data scarcity and the need for sufficient feature information.
